# Project Description

This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust data pipeline that automates the critical stages of data preprocessing, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Python. The primary goal of this pipeline is to enable efficient, reusable, and scalable data preparation for machine learning or analytical tasks. The final deliverable is a Python script and Jupyter Notebook that demonstrate each step of the pipeline clearly.

# Objective

The main objective is to design a robust, modular, and efficient ETL pipeline that can handle various types of raw data inputs. By integrating popular Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, this pipeline addresses common data issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and scaling challenges, ensuring that the prepared data meets the requirements for high-performance analytical and predictive models.

# Tools & Technologies

Jupyter Notebook
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn

# Outcomes

The developed pipeline ensures that data preprocessing is no longer a time-consuming, error-prone manual task but rather an automated, reliable process. Users can input raw data and obtain a fully cleaned, transformed dataset that is ready for analysis or machine learning model training. This project not only enhances workflow efficiency but also promotes code reusability and standardization across different data science projects.
