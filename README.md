# Project Description

This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust data pipeline that automates the critical stages of data preprocessing, transformation and loading (ETL) using Python. The primary goal of this pipeline is to enable efficient, reusable and scalable data preparation for machine learning or analytical tasks. The final deliverable is a Python script and Jupyter Notebook that demonstrate each step of the pipeline clearly.

# Objective

The main objective is to design a robust, modular and efficient ETL pipeline that can handle various types of raw data inputs. By integrating popular Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, this pipeline addresses common data issues such as missing values, inconsistencies and scaling challenges, ensuring that the prepared data meets the requirements for high-performance analytical and predictive models.

# Tools & Technologies

Jupyter Notebook

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

# Key Features

Data Ingestion: Read data from CSV  and perform initial exploration.

Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing or null values, remove duplicates and correct data types.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the datasetâ€™s analytical value.

Encoding & Scaling: Apply techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, standard scaling or normalization to prepare data for modeling.

Pipeline Automation: Combine preprocessing steps into a unified, reusable scikit-learn pipeline, improving reproducibility and efficiency.

Data Loading: Export the final processed data to a CSV file or prepare it directly for modeling.

# Outcomes

The developed pipeline ensures that data preprocessing is no longer a time-consuming, error-prone manual task but rather an automated, reliable process. Users can input raw data and obtain a fully cleaned, transformed dataset that is ready for analysis or machine learning model training. This project not only enhances workflow efficiency but also promotes code reusability and standardization across different data science projects.
